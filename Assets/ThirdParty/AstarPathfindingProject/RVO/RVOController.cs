	/// It does not handle movement itself, but allows the calling script to get the calculated velocity and
	/// use that to move the object using a method it sees fit (for example using a CharacterController, using
	/// transform.Translate or using a rigidbody).
	///
	/// <code>
	/// public void Update () {
	///     // Just some point far away
	///     var targetPoint = transform.position + transform.forward * 100;
	///
	///     // Set the desired point to move towards using a desired speed of 10 and a max speed of 12
	///     controller.SetTarget(targetPoint, 10, 12);
	///
	///     // Calculate how much to move during this frame
	///     // This information is based on movement commands from earlier frames
	///     // as local avoidance is calculated globally at regular intervals by the RVOSimulator component
	///     var delta = controller.CalculateMovementDelta(transform.position, Time.deltaTime);
	///     transform.position = transform.position + delta;
