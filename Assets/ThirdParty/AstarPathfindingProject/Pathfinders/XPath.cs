	/// <summary>
	/// Customized ending condition for a path.
	/// This class can be used to implement a custom ending condition for e.g an Pathfinding.XPath.
	/// Inherit from this class and override the <see cref="TargetFound"/> function to implement you own ending condition logic.
	///
	/// For example, you might want to create an Ending Condition which stops when a node is close enough to a given point.
	/// Then what you do is that you create your own class, let's call it MyEndingCondition and override the function TargetFound to specify our own logic.
	/// We want to inherit from ABPathEndingCondition because only ABPaths have end points defined.
	///
	/// <code>
	/// public class MyEndingCondition : ABPathEndingCondition {
	///
	///     // Maximum world distance to the target node before terminating the path
	///     public float maxDistance = 10;
	///
	///     // Reuse the constructor in the superclass
	///     public MyEndingCondition (ABPath p) : base (p) {}
	///
	///     public override bool TargetFound (PathNode node) {
	///         return ((Vector3)node.node.position - abPath.originalEndPoint).sqrMagnitude <= maxDistance*maxDistance;
	///     }
	/// }
	/// </code>
	///
	/// One part at a time. We need to cast the node's position to a Vector3 since internally, it is stored as an integer coordinate (Int3).
	/// Then we subtract the Pathfinding.Path.originalEndPoint from it to get their difference.
	/// The original end point is always the exact point specified when calling the path.
	/// As a last step we check the squared magnitude (squared distance, it is much faster than the non-squared distance) and check if it is lower or equal to our maxDistance squared.\n
	/// There you have it, it is as simple as that.
	/// Then you simply assign it to the endingCondition variable on, for example an XPath which uses the EndingCondition.
	///
	/// <code>
	/// XPath myXPath = XPath.Construct(startPoint, endPoint);
	/// MyEndingCondition ec = new MyEndingCondition();
	/// ec.maxDistance = 100; // Or some other value
	/// myXPath.endingCondition = ec;
	///
	/// // Calculate the path!
	/// seeker.StartPath (ec);
	/// </code>
	///
	/// Where seeker is a <see cref="Seeker"/> component, and myXPath is an Pathfinding.XPath.\n
	///
	/// Note: The above was written without testing. I hope I haven't made any mistakes, if you try it out, and it doesn't seem to work. Please post a comment in the forums.
